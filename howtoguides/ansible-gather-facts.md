Below are two common ways to make your Ansible play fail if a particular service (for example, `td-agent`) is *not* recognized on the target system. The first uses the **service_facts** module, and the second uses **systemctl** (systemd).

---

## Option 1: Using `service_facts`

1. **Gather all known services** with `service_facts`.
2. **Fail** with the `fail` module if the service name is not in `ansible_facts.services`.

**Example Playbook**:

```yaml
---
- name: Fail if td-agent service is not recognized
  hosts: all
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Gather facts about all known services
      service_facts:

    - name: Fail if td-agent service is not recognized
      fail:
        msg: "The td-agent service is not recognized on this host."
      when: "'td-agent' not in ansible_facts.services"
```

### How It Works
- `service_facts` populates `ansible_facts.services` with a list of all services recognized by the init system (systemd or SysVinit).  
- If `'td-agent'` is **not** a key in `ansible_facts.services`, we explicitly fail the play with the `fail` module.

---

## Option 2: Using `systemctl` (systemd-only)

If you know the target hosts use **systemd**, you can:
1. Run `systemctl status td-agent`.
2. Fail if the return code (`rc`) indicates the service is unknown.

**Example Playbook**:

```yaml
---
- name: Fail if td-agent service is not recognized (systemd)
  hosts: all
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Check status of td-agent
      command: systemctl status td-agent
      register: td_agent_status
      changed_when: false
      failed_when: false  # Don't fail on this task alone

    - name: Fail if td-agent is not recognized
      fail:
        msg: "The td-agent service is not recognized on this system."
      when: td_agent_status.rc != 0
```

### How It Works
- `systemctl status td-agent` will have a **return code of `0`** if the service unit file exists (regardless of whether it’s active or inactive).
- If the service isn’t known, `systemctl` exits with a **non-zero code**, and the second task will force the play to fail.

---

### Which approach to choose?
- **Use `service_facts`** if you want a cross-platform solution (systemd or SysVinit).  
- **Use `systemctl`** if you specifically target systemd-based distributions.

Both methods will fail (and stop the playbook) if the specified service isn’t recognized by the system.
