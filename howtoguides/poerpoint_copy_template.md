### **Additional Tips**

- **Consistency**: Using Slide Masters ensures that any changes you make to the master slide automatically reflect on all slides that use that layout.
- **Backup**: Before making significant changes, it's wise to save a copy of your original presentations.
- **PowerPoint Versions**: The exact names of options and their locations might vary slightly depending on your version of PowerPoint (e.g., PowerPoint 2010, 2013, 2016, 2019, or Microsoft 365). However, the general steps remain similar.
- **Mac Users**: If you're using PowerPoint on macOS, the interface is slightly different, but the functionalities are equivalent.
