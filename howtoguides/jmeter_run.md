To run your JMeter test plan from the terminal, you can use the JMeter command-line interface (CLI). Here are the steps to do that:

### 1. Save Your JMeter Test Plan
Make sure you save your JMeter Test Plan as a `.jmx` file, for example, `fluentd_log_test.jmx`.

### 2. Open a Terminal
Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where Apache JMeter is installed. The JMeter executable is usually located in the `bin` folder of your installation.

### 3. Run JMeter from the Terminal
To execute your test plan, use the following command:

```bash
jmeter -n -t /path/to/your/fluentd_log_test.jmx -l /path/to/your/results/results.jtl
```

Explanation of the command:

- `jmeter`: This is the executable for JMeter.
- `-n`: This runs JMeter in non-GUI mode, which is suitable for executing tests from the command line.
- `-t /path/to/your/fluentd_log_test.jmx`: Specifies the path to your `.jmx` test plan file.
- `-l /path/to/your/results/results.jtl`: Specifies the location where the results will be saved (in JTL format).

### Example Command
If your test plan is in your home directory:

```bash
jmeter -n -t ~/fluentd_log_test.jmx -l ~/results/results.jtl
```

Make sure the paths to the `.jmx` file and the output results directory are correct.

### Additional Options
- **-j** `/path/to/logfile.log`: Specify the location for the JMeter log file.
- **-Jproperty=value**: Pass custom properties to JMeter if needed.

For example:

```bash
jmeter -n -t ~/fluentd_log_test.jmx -l ~/results/results.jtl -j ~/results/jmeter.log
```

### Scheduling Runs
If you want to run this test plan periodically, you can schedule it using `cron` (on Linux/macOS) or Task Scheduler (on Windows).

Make sure that the user running the command has sufficient permissions to create the log files in the `/var/log/calico/` directory. You may need to run the command as `sudo` depending on your system permissions.
