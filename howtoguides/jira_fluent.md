**Title:** Test Load for Fluentd Logging on EC2 Instance  

---

**Description:**  
Conduct load testing for Fluentd logging on an EC2 instance to ensure its performance and reliability under high logging traffic. The test will help identify potential bottlenecks and evaluate Fluentd's capacity to handle sustained and burst logging loads in the configured environment.

---

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
1. Fluentd is configured correctly on the EC2 instance with the expected logging configurations.
2. Simulated logging traffic (both sustained and burst) is generated and processed by Fluentd.
3. Performance metrics are collected, including CPU, memory usage, and throughput.
4. Logs are verified to ensure no data loss or significant delays during high load.
5. Document any performance bottlenecks or failures observed during the test.

---

**Steps to Test:**
1. Launch an EC2 instance configured with Fluentd and logging applications.
2. Simulate log generation using a log generator tool (e.g., `log-generator`, `logger`, or a custom script).
3. Gradually increase logging traffic to simulate sustained and burst loads.
4. Monitor the EC2 instance's resource usage using CloudWatch or other monitoring tools.
5. Validate the logs received at the configured destination (e.g., S3, Elasticsearch, etc.).
6. Capture and analyze Fluentd performance logs for latency or error metrics.

**Environment:**  
- **Instance Type:** [e.g., t2.medium or t3.large]  
- **OS:** [e.g., Amazon Linux 2]  
- **Fluentd Version:** [Specify version, e.g., 1.14.4]  
- **Python Version (if applicable):** [e.g., Python 3.8]  

---

**Dependencies:**

- Fluentd configured with appropriate input and output plugins.  
- Monitoring tools (e.g., CloudWatch, Prometheus) enabled.

---

**Attachments:**  
- Configuration files for Fluentd (`fluent.conf`).  
- Any logs or screenshots captured during testing.
