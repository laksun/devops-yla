# How to Rebase and Resolve Code Conflicts from Bitbucket Using IntelliJ IDEA: A Step-by-Step Guide

Rebasing your local code with the latest changes from a Bitbucket repository and resolving any code conflicts can be efficiently managed using **IntelliJ IDEA**. This guide will walk you through the process step by step to ensure a smooth experience.

---

## **Prerequisites**

- **IntelliJ IDEA** installed on your machine.
- A local clone of the Bitbucket repository.
- Basic understanding of Git concepts like branches, commits, and rebasing.

---

## **Overview**

The general steps are:

1. **Fetch the latest changes from Bitbucket.**
2. **Start the rebase operation in IntelliJ IDEA.**
3. **Resolve any code conflicts that arise.**
4. **Continue the rebase process after resolving conflicts.**
5. **Push the rebased branch back to Bitbucket.**

---

## **Step-by-Step Instructions**

### **Step 1: Fetch the Latest Changes from Bitbucket**

Before starting a rebase, ensure that your local repository is aware of the latest changes from the remote repository.

1. **Open Your Project in IntelliJ IDEA:**
   - Launch IntelliJ IDEA and open your project.

2. **Open the Version Control Window:**
   - Go to **View** > **Tool Windows** > **Version Control** (or press `Alt + 9`).

3. **Fetch Changes:**
   - In the Version Control window, click on the **Git** tab.
   - Click the **Fetch** button (downward arrow icon) in the toolbar.
     - *Alternatively*, you can right-click on your project in the Project view, select **Git** > **Fetch**.
   - This fetches the latest changes from the remote repository without merging them into your local branches.

### **Step 2: Start the Rebase Operation**

Now, you can start rebasing your branch onto the latest version of the target branch.

1. **Open the Branches Popup:**
   - Click on the **Git Branches** icon at the bottom-right corner of IntelliJ IDEA.
     - It displays the current branch name (e.g., `feature/my-branch`).

2. **Select the Branch to Rebase Onto:**
   - In the popup, you'll see a list of local and remote branches.
   - Right-click on the **target branch** you want to rebase onto (e.g., `origin/main` or `origin/master`).
   - Select **Rebase Current onto Selected**.

3. **Confirm the Rebase:**
   - A dialog may appear confirming your action.
   - Click **Rebase** to start the process.

### **Step 3: Handle Conflicts During Rebase**

If there are conflicting changes between your branch and the target branch, Git will pause the rebase process and allow you to resolve them.

1. **Conflict Notification:**
   - IntelliJ IDEA will display a notification indicating that conflicts have been detected.
   - You'll see a list of files with conflicts in the Version Control window under the **Conflicts** tab.

### **Step 4: Resolve Conflicts in IntelliJ IDEA**

IntelliJ IDEA provides a visual merge tool to help you resolve conflicts.

1. **Open the Merge Tool:**
   - In the **Conflicts** tab, select a file with conflicts.
   - Click on **Merge** or right-click the file and select **Resolve Conflicts**.

2. **Understanding the Merge Tool Interface:**
   - The merge window displays three panes:
     - **Left Pane (Local Changes):** Your changes in the current branch.
     - **Right Pane (Incoming Changes):** Changes from the target branch.
     - **Bottom Pane (Result):** The merged result.

3. **Resolving the Conflicts:**
   - For each conflicting section:
     - **Accept Yours:** Click the left arrow to use your changes.
     - **Accept Theirs:** Click the right arrow to use changes from the target branch.
     - **Manual Edit:** Edit directly in the result pane if needed.
   - Use the **Toolbar Buttons**:
     - **Apply All Non-Conflicting Changes:** Automatically merges non-conflicting changes.
     - **Navigate Between Conflicts:** Use the up and down arrows to jump between conflicts.

4. **Mark as Resolved:**
   - Once all conflicts are resolved, click **Apply** and then **Close**.
   - IntelliJ IDEA will mark the file as resolved.

5. **Repeat for All Conflicted Files:**
   - Resolve conflicts in all files listed in the **Conflicts** tab.

### **Step 5: Continue the Rebase Process**

After resolving conflicts, you need to continue the rebase.

1. **Continue Rebase:**
   - IntelliJ IDEA may prompt you to continue the rebase after resolving conflicts.
   - If not, you can manually continue:
     - Open the **Git** menu from the main toolbar.
     - Select **Repositories** > **Continue Rebase**.

2. **Monitor the Rebase Progress:**
   - IntelliJ IDEA will proceed with the rebase.
   - If further conflicts arise, repeat **Steps 3 and 4**.

### **Step 6: Push the Rebased Branch Back to Bitbucket**

After successfully rebasing and resolving conflicts, you need to push your updated branch back to the remote repository.

1. **Push Changes:**
   - Go to **Git** > **Push** (or press `Ctrl + Shift + K` on Windows/Linux or `Command + Shift + K` on macOS).
   - In the Push dialog, confirm the branch and commits to push.
   - Click **Push**.

2. **Force Push if Necessary:**
   - Rebasing rewrites commit history, which may require a force push.
   - In the Push dialog, you may see a warning about non-fast-forward updates.
   - Enable **Force Push** by checking the **"Force push"** option.
     - *Important:* Be cautious with force pushing, especially if others are working on the same branch.
     - Communicate with your team before force pushing to avoid overwriting others' work.

## **Additional Tips**

- **Communicate with Your Team:**
  - Inform team members before performing operations that rewrite history.
  - Coordinate to avoid conflicts and ensure smooth collaboration.

- **Fetch and Pull Regularly:**
  - Keep your local repository updated to minimize conflicts.
  - Regularly fetch and merge or rebase as appropriate.

- **Use Commit Messages Wisely:**
  - Clear commit messages help in understanding changes during conflict resolution.

- **Backup Your Work:**
  - Before starting complex operations like rebasing, consider creating a backup branch:
    ```bash
    git branch backup/my-branch
    ```

- **Understand Rebase vs. Merge:**
  - **Rebase:** Reapplies your commits on top of the target branch, creating a linear history.
  - **Merge:** Combines branches but creates a merge commit, which may lead to a more complex history.

---

## **Troubleshooting**

- **Rebase Aborted Unexpectedly:**
  - If the rebase process is interrupted, you can restart it:
    ```bash
    git rebase --continue
    ```
  - Or abort and start over:
    ```bash
    git rebase --abort
    ```

- **Conflicts Keep Arising:**
  - Ensure you're rebasing onto the correct branch.
  - Double-check that you've resolved all conflicts properly.

- **Force Push Denied:**
  - You may not have permission to force push to certain branches (e.g., protected branches).
  - Contact your repository administrator if necessary.

## **Conclusion**

By following these steps, you can smoothly rebase your code and resolve any conflicts using IntelliJ IDEA. This process helps maintain a clean commit history and integrates your changes with the latest updates from the Bitbucket repository.
