Certainly! To modify the playbook to include both Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and 9, we'll adjust the `when` clause for the Red Hat tasks to check if the `ansible_facts['distribution_major_version']` is either `'8'` or `'9'`. This ensures that the Python 3.11 installation will run on both RHEL 8 and RHEL 9 systems.

Here's the updated Ansible playbook:

```yaml
---
- name: Install Python based on OS
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:

    - name: Install Python 3.8 on Amazon Linux 2
      when:
        - ansible_facts['distribution'] == 'Amazon'
        - ansible_facts['distribution_major_version'] == '2'
      block:
        - name: Install Python 3.8 via amazon-linux-extras
          amazon.aws.amazon_linux_extras:
            name: python3.8
            state: present

        - name: Install python38 package
          yum:
            name: python38
            state: present

    - name: Install Python 3.11 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 or 9
      when:
        - ansible_facts['os_family'] == 'RedHat'
        - ansible_facts['distribution_major_version'] in ['8', '9']
      block:
        - name: Install required development packages
          yum:
            name:
              - gcc
              - openssl-devel
              - bzip2-devel
              - libffi-devel
              - zlib-devel
              - wget
              - make
            state: present

        - name: Download Python 3.11 source code
          get_url:
            url: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.0/Python-3.11.0.tgz
            dest: /usr/src/Python-3.11.0.tgz
            mode: '0755'
            checksum: 'sha256:8c1621f6ae3247c3990fe17134cc58094d9a50157019b00d66e34b38b59a2e37'

        - name: Extract Python source code
          unarchive:
            src: /usr/src/Python-3.11.0.tgz
            dest: /usr/src/
            remote_src: yes

        - name: Configure Python 3.11
          command: ./configure --enable-optimizations
          args:
            chdir: /usr/src/Python-3.11.0
            creates: /usr/src/Python-3.11.0/Makefile

        - name: Build and install Python 3.11
          command: make altinstall
          args:
            chdir: /usr/src/Python-3.11.0
            creates: /usr/local/bin/python3.11
```

**Explanation:**

- **Modified `when` Clause for RHEL Tasks:**
  - Updated the `when` clause to include both version `'8'` and `'9'`:
    ```yaml
    when:
      - ansible_facts['os_family'] == 'RedHat'
      - ansible_facts['distribution_major_version'] in ['8', '9']
    ```
  - This ensures that the Python 3.11 installation block runs on both RHEL 8 and RHEL 9 systems.

- **Ensuring Python 3.8 Is Not Installed on RHEL:**
  - The `when` clause for installing Python 3.8 on Amazon Linux 2 is specific to that distribution:
    ```yaml
    when:
      - ansible_facts['distribution'] == 'Amazon'
      - ansible_facts['distribution_major_version'] == '2'
    ```
  - This prevents the Python 3.8 installation tasks from running on RHEL systems.

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Fact Gathering:**
  - Ensure that Ansible fact gathering is enabled so that `ansible_facts` are available for use in the `when` clauses.
  - By default, Ansible gathers facts unless explicitly disabled.

- **Ansible Version Compatibility:**
  - The `amazon.aws.amazon_linux_extras` module is part of the `amazon.aws` collection. Ensure you have this collection installed. You can install it with:
    ```bash
    ansible-galaxy collection install amazon.aws
    ```
  - Alternatively, specify the collection at the top of your playbook:
    ```yaml
    ---
    collections:
      - amazon.aws
    ```

- **Idempotency:**
  - The playbook uses `creates` parameters in command tasks to prevent re-running the same commands if the desired state is already achieved.
  - The package installation tasks use `state: present`, which ensures packages are installed if not already present.

- **Testing on RHEL 9:**
  - Verify that all the development packages and dependencies are available and compatible with RHEL 9.

**Usage:**

Save the updated playbook to a file, for example, `install_python.yml`, and run it with:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i your_inventory_file install_python.yml
```

Replace `your_inventory_file` with the path to your inventory file that lists the target hosts.

**Final Notes:**

- **Ensuring Correct OS Detection:**
  - You can verify the detected operating system and version by running:
    ```bash
    ansible all -m setup -a 'filter=ansible_distribution*'
    ```
  - This will display the distribution facts for all hosts, allowing you to confirm that the `ansible_facts['os_family']` and `ansible_facts['distribution_major_version']` are correctly identified.

- **Alternative Conditionals:**
  - If you anticipate variations in the `distribution` fact, you can use `ansible_facts['os_family']` as a more general condition, which we have done in the updated `when` clause.

- **Python Version Verification:**
  - After running the playbook, you can verify the installed Python versions on your hosts:
    ```bash
    ansible all -a 'python3.8 --version'
    ansible all -a 'python3.11 --version'
    ```
  - Replace `python3.8` and `python3.11` with the appropriate binary paths if necessary.

By adjusting the `when` clauses as shown, the playbook now accurately targets Amazon Linux 2 for Python 3.8 installation and Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions 8 or 9 for Python 3.11 installation, ensuring that the tasks are executed only on the intended systems.
