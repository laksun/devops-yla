If JMeter's **OS Process Sampler** is not recognizing the failed command (`ls /nonexistent_directory`) as an error, it's likely because the **default behavior** of JMeter's OS Process Sampler does not automatically interpret non-zero exit codes as failures.

Here's how to configure JMeter to detect and report such errors properly:

### Steps to Handle OS Command Failures in JMeter

1. **Add the OS Process Sampler**:
    - **Command**: `ls`
    - **Arguments**: `/nonexistent_directory`

2. **Check the Return Code**:
    - In the **OS Process Sampler**, there is an option called **Check Return Code**.
    - Set **Expected Return Code** to `0` (because a return code of `0` means success in Unix/Linux).

3. **Add an Assertion**:
    - Right-click the **OS Process Sampler** → **Add** → **Assertions** → **JSR223 Assertion** (or **Response Assertion**).
    - In the JSR223 Assertion, add the following Groovy code to check the exit code:

      ```groovy
      if (prev.getResponseCode().toInteger() != 0) {
          AssertionResult.setFailure(true)
          AssertionResult.setFailureMessage("OS Command failed with return code: " + prev.getResponseCode())
      }
      ```

4. **Add a Listener**:
    - Right-click the OS Process Sampler → **Add** → **Listener** → **View Results Tree**.

5. **Run the Test**:
    - Execute the test and check the results in **View Results Tree**.

### Explanation

- **Non-Zero Exit Codes**: In Unix/Linux, commands that fail return a **non-zero exit code**. For example, `ls /nonexistent_directory` returns `2`.
  
- **Check Return Code**: Setting **Expected Return Code** to `0` makes JMeter expect a successful execution. If the return code differs, JMeter can flag it.

- **Assertions**: The **JSR223 Assertion** with the Groovy script explicitly checks the exit code and marks the sampler as a failure if it’s non-zero.

### Alternative Approach Using Response Assertion

You can also use a **Response Assertion** to check for error messages in the output.

1. Add a **Response Assertion**.
2. Set **Pattern Matching Rules**:
   - **Field to Test**: `Response Data`
   - **Patterns to Test**: Add a pattern like `No such file or directory`.

This way, JMeter flags the sampler as a failure if the expected error message appears in the output.

### Summary

By configuring **Check Return Code** and adding appropriate assertions, JMeter can properly recognize OS command failures and report them as errors.
