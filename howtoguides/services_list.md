In Linux, particularly on systems using `systemd`, the terms **active** and **running** refer to the state of services, but they have slightly different meanings:

### 1. **Active**
- **Active** means the service is currently running or has successfully completed its task.
- A service can be active but not necessarily performing an ongoing task, especially in the case of services that are triggered by specific events and stop when the task is done (e.g., `oneshot` services).

Example of a command to list active services:

```bash
systemctl list-units --type=service --state=active
```

### 2. **Running**
- **Running** is a specific state under the umbrella of active. It indicates that a service is actively executing and performing its intended operation.
- A service that is in a **running** state is constantly working, like a web server (`httpd`), which continually runs until it's manually stopped or encounters an error.

You can list all services that are actively running using:

```bash
systemctl | grep running
```

This will show services that are both active and have ongoing tasks (in the running state).

### Summary:
- **Active**: The service is either running or has successfully completed its job.
- **Running**: The service is currently performing its task and is in operation.
