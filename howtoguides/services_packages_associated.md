To detect the packages associated with a service in Amazon Linux 2, you can use a combination of commands that help you identify which package provides the service. Here’s how you can do it:

### 1. **Find the Service Unit File**
Service files are usually located in `/usr/lib/systemd/system/` or `/etc/systemd/system/`. You can find the service unit file location by using:

```bash
systemctl status <service_name>
```

This will show you the path to the service file (e.g., `/usr/lib/systemd/system/<service_name>.service`).

### 2. **Identify the Executable**
Open the service unit file to find the executable that the service runs. You can use a command like `cat` or `less`:

```bash
cat /usr/lib/systemd/system/<service_name>.service
```

Look for the `ExecStart` line. This will show the binary or script that is executed to start the service.

### 3. **Find the Package That Provides the Executable**
Once you have the executable or script path, use the following command to find out which package provides it:

```bash
rpm -qf <path_to_executable>
```

For example:

```bash
rpm -qf /usr/sbin/httpd
```

This will show the package name, which you can then uninstall if needed.

### 4. **Check Dependencies**
If you want to ensure you’re also removing dependencies, you can use `yum` to see which packages depend on the package you’re about to remove:

```bash
sudo yum deplist <package_name>
```

This will list any dependencies related to the package.

### 5. **List All Installed Packages Related to a Service**
Alternatively, you can search for packages that have the service name in their description:

```bash
yum list installed | grep <service_name>
```

This can give you an idea of related packages that might also be part of the service setup.

By following these steps, you should be able to detect the packages associated with a particular service.
