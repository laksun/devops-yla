To check if a service is running and then conditionally copy a file based on that in Ansible for RHEL 8, you can use the `ansible.builtin.systemd` module to check the service status and then conditionally execute the file copy with the `ansible.builtin.copy` module. Here’s how you can structure this in a playbook:

```yaml
- name: Ensure service is running and conditionally copy file
  hosts: target_host
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Check if the service is running
      ansible.builtin.systemd:
        name: your_service_name
        state: started
        enabled: yes
      register: service_status
      ignore_errors: yes  # In case the service isn't running, prevent failure here.

    - name: Conditionally copy file if service is active
      ansible.builtin.copy:
        src: /path/to/source/file
        dest: /path/to/destination/
      when: service_status.status == 'running'
```

### Explanation

1. **Service Check**: The `ansible.builtin.systemd` module is used to ensure the service is in the `started` state. This step registers the status in `service_status`.
2. **Conditional Copy**: The `ansible.builtin.copy` task runs only if `service_status.status` is `'running'`, ensuring the file copy happens only when the service is active.

To add CloudWatch log collection to Fluentd, you need to configure Fluentd to forward logs to AWS CloudWatch Logs. You can do this by using the `fluent-plugin-cloudwatch-logs` plugin, which provides direct integration with CloudWatch. Here’s how to set it up:

### Step 1: Install the `fluent-plugin-cloudwatch-logs` Plugin

If it's not already installed, add the CloudWatch plugin to Fluentd:

```bash
td-agent-gem install fluent-plugin-cloudwatch-logs
```

### Step 2: Configure Fluentd to Forward Logs to CloudWatch

In your Fluentd configuration file (`/etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf` or `/etc/fluent/fluent.conf`), add a section to match the logs you want to send to CloudWatch. Here’s an example configuration:

```conf
<match your.log.tag>
  @type cloudwatch_logs
  log_group_name your-log-group-name           # Name of your CloudWatch log group
  log_stream_name your-log-stream-name         # Name of your CloudWatch log stream
  auto_create_stream true                      # Automatically create the stream if it doesn't exist
  region us-west-2                             # Set your AWS region
  aws_key_id YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID            # AWS Access Key ID (or leave out for IAM role)
  aws_sec_key YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY       # AWS Secret Access Key (or leave out for IAM role)
  <buffer>
    flush_interval 5s                          # Buffering interval for log forwarding
  </buffer>
</match>
```

Replace `your.log.tag`, `your-log-group-name`, `your-log-stream-name`, `us-west-2`, `YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, and `YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` with values that match your setup. 

### Notes on Configuration:

1. **AWS Credentials**: You can use an IAM role with appropriate CloudWatch Logs permissions if Fluentd runs on an EC2 instance. If using IAM roles, omit `aws_key_id` and `aws_sec_key`.
2. **Log Group and Stream**: Ensure that `log_group_name` and `log_stream_name` are unique per application or system you’re monitoring. 
3. **Buffering and Flush Interval**: Adjust the `flush_interval` to control how often logs are pushed. This can impact the timeliness and costs associated with log streaming.

### Step 3: Restart Fluentd

After updating the configuration, restart Fluentd to apply the new settings:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart td-agent
```

This setup should enable Fluentd to collect logs and forward them to AWS CloudWatch Logs.
