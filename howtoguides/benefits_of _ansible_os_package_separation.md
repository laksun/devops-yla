Creating separate Ansible roles for different operating systems, such as Red Hat 7, 8, and 9, has several advantages:

1. **OS-specific customization**: Each Red Hat version may have different package versions, system configurations, and requirements. Separate roles allow you to account for these differences without making a single role overly complex with many conditionals.

2. **Code clarity and maintainability**: By isolating the logic for each OS version, your Ansible code will be easier to maintain. Changes or updates for one OS won't affect the others, reducing the risk of breaking something in production.

3. **Modularity and reusability**: Separate roles can be reused independently for future projects or when new AMIs are created for a specific version. This makes your configuration more modular.

4. **Simplified troubleshooting**: If issues arise in a specific OS environment, having a separate role makes it easier to debug, as you can narrow down the problem to the OS-specific configuration without combing through unnecessary logic.

5. **Better testing and deployment**: Testing can be done more effectively because each role is isolated to a specific operating system. You can create targeted tests for each version, leading to more reliable deployments.

6. **Scalability**: If new Red Hat versions are released in the future, you can simply add a new role for that version without altering the existing ones.

This structure aligns with best practices for managing different environments with infrastructure-as-code tools like Ansible.
