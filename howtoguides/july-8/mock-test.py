### ❌ Error Explanation

From the terminal at the bottom of your screenshot:

```
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'dynamodb_table_data/schema.json'
```

This error occurred at:

```python
with open("dynamodb_table_data/schema.json", "rb") as fp:
```

---

### 🧨 Root Cause

Python is trying to open the file `dynamodb_table_data/schema.json`, but it **cannot find it relative to the working directory** when `pytest` runs.

---

### ✅ How to Fix

You have **two options**, depending on where `schema.json` is actually located:

---

#### ✅ Option 1: Use an Absolute Path (Recommended for tests)

Update the test to use a path relative to the current file:

```python
import os

def test_handler_success(boto3, mock_proxy):
    base_path = os.path.dirname(__file__)
    schema_path = os.path.join(base_path, "dynamodb_table_data", "schema.json")

    with open(schema_path, "rb") as fp:
        schema = fp.read()
```

➡️ This ensures the file is located correctly no matter where the test is run from.

---

#### ✅ Option 2: Move the File

If the file `schema.json` exists somewhere in your project, move or symlink it to the expected location:

```
project-root/
├── tests/
│   ├── unit/
│   │   ├── lambdas/
│   │   │   ├── test_configure_imported_dynamodb_table.py
│   │   │   ├── dynamodb_table_data/
│   │   │   │   └── schema.json  ← ✅ file should be here
```

---

### ⚠️ Bonus Tip



If you're not using custom pytest markers in `pytest.ini`, **you should remove or rename it**. Otherwise, declare it in `pytest.ini`:

```ini
# pytest.ini
[pytest]
markers =
    
```

---

Let me know if you want to **mock the file read instead**, or need help setting up test data fixtures.
