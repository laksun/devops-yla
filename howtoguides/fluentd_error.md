 Issue with InSpec Rule for Fluentd Log Files



I wanted to share an ongoing issue I've noticed with our current InSpec test for Fluentd logs during AMI validation. The InSpec rule:

```ruby
describe file("/var/log/fluent/fluentd.log") do
  its("content") { should_not match /(\[error\]|failed to flush|deprecated)/ }
end
```

This rule is intermittently failing because Fluentd sometimes produces error logs when log file paths listed in `fluentd.conf` do not exist. These missing files generate errors in `/var/log/fluent/fluentd.log`, causing the test to fail inconsistently.

To improve reliability, I suggest modifying the InSpec rule to avoid treating these non-existing log file paths as errors. Here's a possible approach:

```ruby
describe file("/var/log/fluent/fluentd.log") do
  it { should exist }
  its("content") { should_not match /(\[error\](?!.*file not found)|failed to flush|deprecated)/ }
end
```

This updated rule still checks for general errors, but excludes errors related to missing log files, ensuring more consistent test results.

Let me know if you have any thoughts or further suggestions.

Thanks,
