Below is an example InSpec control that verifies Fluentd is installed by checking that at least one of the following locations exists:

- **/opt/fluentd** – if you’ve installed Fluentd in a custom location,
- **/usr/sbin/fluentd** – if it’s installed as a system service (the binary should exist and be executable), or
- **/usr/lib64/fluentd** – if it’s installed as a Ruby gem.

You can use a `describe.one` block so that if any one of these checks passes, the control passes overall:

```ruby
control 'fluentd-installation-check' do
  impact 1.0
  title 'Check that Fluentd is installed'
  desc 'Fluentd should be installed on the system. Depending on how it was installed, its files might be located in /opt/fluentd (custom install), /usr/sbin/fluentd (system service), or /usr/lib64/fluentd (Ruby gem installation).'

  describe.one do
    describe directory('/opt/fluentd') do
      it { should exist }
    end

    describe file('/usr/sbin/fluentd') do
      it { should exist }
      it { should be_executable }
    end

    describe directory('/usr/lib64/fluentd') do
      it { should exist }
    end
  end
end
```

### Explanation

- **`describe.one` block:**  
  This ensures that if *any one* of the nested tests passes, the overall control is considered successful.

- **Check for `/opt/fluentd`:**  
  The test checks that a directory exists at `/opt/fluentd`, which is common for a custom Fluentd installation.

- **Check for `/usr/sbin/fluentd`:**  
  This test confirms that the Fluentd binary exists at `/usr/sbin/fluentd` and is executable, which is typical when Fluentd is installed as a system service.

- **Check for `/usr/lib64/fluentd`:**  
  If Fluentd is installed as a Ruby gem, related files might be under `/usr/lib64/fluentd`. This test checks for the existence of that directory.

By using these tests together, you ensure that Fluentd is properly installed in one of the expected locations on your RHEL 9 system.
