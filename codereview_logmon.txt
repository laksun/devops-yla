Here's a detailed review of the code:

### 1. **Code Structure and Readability:**
   - **Imports:**
     - The code contains duplicate imports (`time` and `subprocess`). This is unnecessary and can be removed.
     - The imports are not organized, making the code less readable. It's better to organize them into standard library imports, third-party imports, and local imports.

   - **Global Variables:**
     - `s3ConfigFile`, `chmodList`, `chmod_recursive`, and `chmod_dir_recursive` are global variables that are used within the `main()` function. Consider encapsulating these within a configuration object or as constants in a configuration file if they need to be reused.

### 2. **Code Efficiency and Best Practices:**
   - **Repeated System Calls:**
     - The code frequently uses `os.system()` and `subprocess.call()` with `shell=True`. This approach is risky as it opens the code to shell injection vulnerabilities if any input is user-controlled. It’s safer to use the subprocess module with a list of arguments rather than a shell command string.
     - Additionally, `os.system` is considered a legacy method and using `subprocess.run()` or similar would be more appropriate.

   - **Error Handling:**
     - Error handling in `is_agent_running` could be more informative. The exception is caught, but no details about the error are logged or returned. It would be beneficial to log the error message to help with debugging.
     - In the `main()` loop, catching a broad `Exception` is generally not recommended. Instead, more specific exceptions should be caught where possible.

   - **Hardcoded Values:**
     - The script contains hardcoded paths and commands (`/etc/init.d/`, `pkill -9 -f`, etc.), which makes it less flexible and harder to maintain. These could be extracted into configuration variables or parameters.

   - **Redundant Code:**
     - In the `main()` loop, there is a block that resets `fluentd_check_counter` to `0` twice under different conditions. This seems redundant and could be optimized to only reset once if necessary.

   - **Functionality:**
     - The logic inside the `main()` loop is overly complex, especially the chmod operations that involve splitting strings multiple times. It would be clearer and more maintainable to extract this logic into separate functions.

### 3. **Algorithmic Concerns:**
   - **Efficiency:**
     - The script uses `find` command with `os.system()` calls in a loop, which can be slow, especially on large directories. Consider using Python’s `os.walk()` or `Pathlib` for a more Pythonic and potentially faster solution.
     - The loop in `main()` with `time.sleep(60)` will always sleep for 60 seconds even if the agent is not running, leading to a potential delay in restarting the agent.

   - **Logic Issues:**
     - The `fluentd_check_counter` is reset to `0` inside both the condition that checks if the agent is stopped and within the `else` block of that condition. This means the counter will be reset even if the agent is not restarted, which might not be the intended behavior.

### 4. **PEP-8 Compliance:**
   - **Line Length:**
     - Some lines in the code are longer than 79 characters, which is the recommended line length according to PEP-8. These should be broken into multiple lines for better readability.

   - **Function and Variable Naming:**
     - The function `is_agent_running()` could have a more descriptive name, like `check_agent_status()`, which would be more consistent with Python's naming conventions.
     - The variable `key` in the `except` block is not a meaningful name. Consider renaming it to something more descriptive, like `error`.

### 5. **Logging:**
   - The code logs some information, but it could be more detailed, especially in error scenarios. Additionally, setting up different logging levels (DEBUG, INFO, ERROR) could be useful to provide more control over what gets logged.

### 6. **Concurrency:**
   - The code runs in an infinite loop with a sleep interval of 60 seconds. Depending on the application, it might be worth considering threading or asynchronous execution if the check should be more responsive or if it could handle multiple agents simultaneously.

### 7. **Pythonic Improvements:**
   - Use list comprehensions, where appropriate, to make the code more concise.
   - Leverage Python's `with` statement for better handling of subprocesses to ensure resources are managed correctly.

### **Summary of Recommendations:**
1. Remove redundant imports and organize them.
2. Replace `os.system()` and `subprocess.call()` with safer alternatives.
3. Refactor hardcoded paths and commands into configuration files or constants.
4. Simplify logic within the `main()` function, especially regarding the `chmod` operations.
5. Improve error handling and logging to capture more detailed information.
6. Optimize the loop to prevent unnecessary delays and redundant checks.
