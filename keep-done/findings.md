Hello,

In preparation for upgrading Fluentd to version **5.0.4** and separating the CloudWatch agent into a standalone package for Amazon Linux 2 (AL2) and other AMIs, I have made the following findings:

---

### **Python Code Analysis**

1. **Occurrences of 'CloudWatch':** There are a total of **50 matches** across two Python scripts:
   - **`logmon_config_mon`**: 11 instances.
     - **Affected Methods:**
       - `add_ec2_data_to_defaults()`
       - `main()`
   - **`logmon_config_execution`**: 39 instances.
     - **Affected Methods:**
       - `add_ec2_data_to_defaults()`
       - `main()`
       - `replace_td_agent_placeholders()`
       - `configure_cloudwatch_agent()`

---

### **Linux Services Consideration**

2. **Separation Impact:**
   - Splitting logmon for the CloudWatch agent and Fluentd 5.0.4 will necessitate creating **two separate logmon services**.
   - **Overlap Handling:**
     - The overlapping logic between these services must be managed carefully to prevent conflicts.

---

### **Proposed Plan**

- **Refactoring Logmon Code:**
  - I suggest handling the refactoring of the logmon code in a **separate ticket** to maintain clarity and focus.
- **Upgrade Sequence:**
  - **First**, proceed with upgrading Fluentd to version **5.0.4**.
  - **Subsequently**, address the separation of the CloudWatch agent.

---

### **Request for Feedback**

- **Areas for Consideration:**
  - Are there any specific points I should keep in mind while creating two services for logmon?
  - Do you foresee any potential issues with this approach?

I appreciate your input on this plan to ensure a smooth upgrade and separation process.
